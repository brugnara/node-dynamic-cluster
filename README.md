NodeJS Dynamic Cluster
======================

NodeJS Dynamic Cluster is a way to manipulate your cluster size via a simple API, provided
by this module. You will be able to resize the cluster with a simple `curl localhost:8080/scale/X`
instead of relaunch your application.

This module uses the native [cluster module](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html), with just some pepper.

It is dependant on `Debug` only. 

Please use the last version as the first (1.0.x and 1.1.x) use KoaJS.

Any help or hint will be appreciated.
